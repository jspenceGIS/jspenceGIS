- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan Spence
- 👀 I’m interested in how GIS and GIS Programming can be used to inform carbon capture policy and deployment
- 🌱 I’m currently completing my PhD in the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department at the University of Alberta
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on any projects integrating GIS into carbon capture research
- 📫 I can be reached by email at jspence2@ualberta.ca
